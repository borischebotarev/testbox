Welcome to your Get Schooled Interview Coaching session! Today we're going to practice interviewing for a job at a coffee shop. Remember, interviewing is a skill set anyone can become proficient in with practice. The point of today's exercise is to begin that process so that you can nail your next real-life interview! Today's coaching session will take 15 minutes. Given this, please be thoughtful about your time management so you can get through all of the questions. At the end of our conversation, I'll give you helpful feedback about what you did well, and how to improve for next time. To begin our conversation, please press the start button. I'll then pose my first question, and when you're done responding, click the stop button that will soon appear. Please use this start/stop approach for each question and I'm ready when you are!
Great, let's begin. Can you please tell me why you want to work at a coffee shop?
Outstanding, thank you. Let's dive a little bit deeper. What do you think are the key responsibilities of a barista, or someone working at a coffee shop?
Great, thank you. So do you have any experience working in a coffee shop and, if not, do you have any work or life experiences that would help you excel in this kind of work environment?
That's great, thank you. What are you most excited to learn while working at our coffee shop?
Outstanding, thank you. Okay so let's build on that last question. Do you have any thoughts about how this experience might connect to your longer term education, and/or your career goals?
Okay, great. So let's dig a little deeper into coffee shop dynamics. First, everybody knows coffee shops can be extremely busy at times; given this, how would you go about prioritizing tasks when faced with multiple customers and orders all happening - say - during that morning rush hour?
Splendid. Here's another one. Your co-worker has been spilling milk, coffee grounds, and syrups on the floor in their effort to keep up during the peak hour demand making your work space very unsafe. What would you do in this situation, and how would you handle your relationship with your work colleague given their behavior?
Fantastic. Okay, here's our last hypothetical. How would you go about handling a customer who is frustrated by their order being made incorrectly - and complaining out loud about being late for a work meeting as a result?
Super, thanks. Okay, here's our second to last question, and it's about managers. Almost everyone of us has one! Can you please describe a situation where you had to follow instructions or guidelines given by a manager or a teacher? How did you handle it and what was the outcome?
Outstanding! Okay so for our last question let's get philosophical: what do you think sets a great coffee shop experience apart from an average one, and how can a potential employee like you contribute to creating an outstanding experience?
Great, that's it - we are finished! Very well done! I hope that was helpful in preparing you for your upcoming interviews.
